## About

### ⭐ Hi! I'm James.

I'm a coding tutor with over a decade of experience [working on all sorts of coding projects](https://github.com/JamesABaker). I've worked at the European Bioinformatics Institute, the University of Manchester, the Ministry of Justice, and even the UK Health Security Agency during the pandemic.

Throughout my career I've built enterprise level data services, AI programs, published academic computational genetic analyses, and lead dev and data science teams solving meaningful national-scale problems.

In all that, my favourite work has always been teaching young people about technology.

## Teaching Experience

In summary, I have taught learners from primary school to university level and professionals 📚.

- 🧑‍💻 I've volunteered as a Code Club mentor for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, delivered workshops in schools
- 🎓 Private tutoring
- 👨‍💼 Delivered workshops on various coding aspects to students and professionals
- 👾 🧬 Won funding from the Wellcome Trust to run hands-on sessions where children learn science through video games
- I was featured in the Sanger blog post on "Inspiring prisoners and their families with genomics"

## Tutoring Approach

I love helping learners discover that programming is creative, playful, social and something anyone can enjoy.

### 👦👧 *What will your child learn?*

My lessons are designed specifically for KS2 learners (ages 7-11). For KS1, check out the free [Scratch Junior App](https://www.scratchjr.org/) 😻.  My approach may be useful for some older children catching up on coding and computing. The lessons will cover concepts in the DfE National curriculum for England, and usually we will go beyond the curriculum very swiftly.

I will start by loosely adhering to the [Raspberry Pi's scratch modules](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/scratch) which cover algorithms, and building with code. If your child is less interested in making games or programming animations, and is more interested in technology and robots, we will follow the [BBC's micro:bit projects](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/). 🎓 These can be followed by a gentle introduction to Python when they are ready (a widely used text based programming language).

Beyond the meat of the coding, there are also other skills we will cover like digital safety, and how to use search tools effectively.

I'm patient, friendly, and great at explaining complex ideas in simple steps using multiple methods to get the concepts across.

Whether your child is a total beginner or already curious about coding, I adapt sessions to their pace, interests, and confidence level.
